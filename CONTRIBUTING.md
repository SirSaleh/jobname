# Contributing

First of all, thank you for reading here to contribute! I really appriciate that. <br />
Please do not modify files in the `book` directory as they are generated by `mdbook`. Make changes in the `src` directory instead.

## Share experience
If you want to share your interview experience, If the company exist in the `src`, create a directory with company name and put each experience on it.
If the company is not exist, just create a `md` file with company name in the `src` dir. Then for compile, you need to add your `md` file to `SUMMARY.md`.
Just like this:
```
src/snapp
├── snapp_cab_1.md
├── snapp_cab_2.md
├── snapp_market_pro.md
└── snapp.md
```
You can add your name (if you like) after the company name like: `snapp_moein.md` and that's good to write it in the file otherwise, write `unknown`.

## Install
You need to install mdbook. Just install binaries if you are not familiar with `rust` and `cargo`.
<br/ >Watch this [link](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases) for releases.

## Build
For building after your changes in the root dir of project:
```
mdbook build .

```

Or you can build and serve to watch your changes:

```
mdbook serve --open

```
